# LUNARIS PROJECT, DESCRIPTION:
Lunaris is a sleek, fully-authenticated web application that merges elegant design with practical functionality. Crafted using vanilla JavaScript, Firebase Authentication, and lightweight CSS animations, Lunaris demonstrates how minimal, clean code can deliver a polished, production-ready user experience. Lunaris is more than just a demonstration; itâ€™s a learning-focused, production-ready prototype showcasing the power of modern web development with lightweight tools. Its primary goal is to provide a clean, functional, and elegant interface for authenticated users, while emphasizing simplicity, and maintainability.

An enthusiast interested in elegant UI/UX design,
Lunaris provides a hands-on example of best practices in modern web development.
